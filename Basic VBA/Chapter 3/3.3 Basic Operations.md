## 3.3 Basic Operations

### Arithmetic Operators

VBA provides a set of arithmetic operators to perform mathematical calculations. These operators work with numeric data types (Byte, Integer, Long, Single, Double, Currency, Decimal).

| Operator | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `+` | Addition | `result = x + y` |
| `-` | Subtraction | `result = x - y` |
| `*` | Multiplication | `result = x * y` |
| `/` | Division | `result = x / y` |
| `\` | Integer Division | `result = x \ y` (returns the integer part of the division) |
| `Mod` | Modulo (remainder of division) | `result = x Mod y` |
| `^` | Exponentiation | `result = x ^ y` (x raised to the power of y) |

**Examples:**

```vba
Dim x As Integer, y As Integer, result As Integer

x = 10
y = 3

result = x + y ' Addition: result = 13
result = x - y ' Subtraction: result = 7
result = x * y ' Multiplication: result = 30
result = x / y ' Division: result = 3.333333 (Double if result is not Integer)
result = x \ y ' Integer Division: result = 3
result = x Mod y ' Modulo: result = 1 (remainder of 10 / 3)
result = x ^ y ' Exponentiation: result = 1000 (10 raised to the power of 3)

Debug.Print result
```

### Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to perform logical operations on Boolean values (True or False).

| Operator | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `And` | Logical AND | `result = a And b` (True if both a and b are True) |
| `Or` | Logical OR | `result = a Or b` (True if either a or b is True) |
| `Not` | Logical NOT | `result = Not a` (True if a is False, and vice versa) |
| `Xor` | Logical XOR (Exclusive OR) | `result = a Xor b` (True if either a or b is True, but not both) |
| `Eqv` | Logical Equivalence | `result = a Eqv b` (True if a and b are the same) |
| `Imp` | Logical Implication | `result = a Imp b` (True unless a is True and b is False) |

**Examples:**

```vba
Dim a As Boolean, b As Boolean, result As Boolean

a = True
b = False

result = a And b ' Logical AND: result = False
result = a Or b ' Logical OR: result = True
result = Not a ' Logical NOT: result = False
result = a Xor b ' Logical XOR: result = True
result = a Eqv b ' Logical Equivalence: result = False
result = a Imp b ' Logical Implication: result = False

Debug.Print result
```

### Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare two values and return a Boolean result (True or False).

| Operator | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `=` | Equal to | `result = x = y` |
| `<>` | Not equal to | `result = x <> y` |
| `<` | Less than | `result = x < y` |
| `>` | Greater than | `result = x > y` |
| `<=` | Less than or equal to | `result = x <= y` |
| `>=` | Greater than or equal to | `result = x >= y` |
| `Like` | Pattern matching | `result = str Like "A*"` (True if str starts with "A") |

**Examples:**

```vba
Dim x As Integer, y As Integer, result As Boolean
Dim str As String

x = 10
y = 5
str = "Apple"

result = x = y ' Equal to: result = False
result = x <> y ' Not equal to: result = True
result = x < y ' Less than: result = False
result = x > y ' Greater than: result = True
result = x <= 10 ' Less than or equal to: result = True
result = x >= 5 ' Greater than or equal to: result = True
result = str Like "A*" ' Pattern matching: result = True (str starts with "A")

Debug.Print result
```

### Working with Cells and Ranges in Excel

VBA provides powerful tools for interacting with cells and ranges in Excel worksheets.

-   **Range Object:**
    -   Represents a single cell or a range of cells.
    -   You can use the `Range` property of the `Worksheet` object to get a `Range` object.

    ```vba
    Dim myRange As Range
    Set myRange = Worksheets("Sheet1").Range("A1:C5") ' Represents the range A1 to C5 on Sheet1
    Set myRange = Worksheets("Sheet1").Range("A1", "C5") ' Another way to represent the range A1 to C5
    Set myRange = Range("A1") ' Refers to cell A1 on the active sheet
    ```

-   **Cells Property:**
    -   The `Cells` property of the `Worksheet` or `Range` object allows you to access individual cells within a worksheet or range using their row and column indices.

    ```vba
    Worksheets("Sheet1").Cells(1, 1).Value = "Hello" ' Sets the value of cell A1 on Sheet1 to "Hello"
    myRange.Cells(2, 3).Value = 100 ' Sets the value of the cell in the 2nd row and 3rd column of myRange to 100
    ```

-   **Value Property:**
    -   The `Value` property is used to get or set the value of a cell or range.

    ```vba
    Debug.Print Worksheets("Sheet1").Range("A1").Value ' Prints the value of cell A1 on Sheet1
    Worksheets("Sheet1").Range("B2").Value = 100 ' Sets the value of cell B2 on Sheet1 to 100
    ```

-   **Other Useful Properties and Methods:**
    -   `Rows.Count`: Returns the number of rows in a range.
    -   `Columns.Count`: Returns the number of columns in a range.
    -   `ClearContents`: Clears the contents of a range.
    -   `ClearFormats`: Clears the formatting of a range.
    -   `Copy`: Copies a range to the clipboard or another location.
    -   `Cut`: Cuts a range to the clipboard.
    -   `Delete`: Deletes a range.

**Example:**

```vba
Sub UpdateRange()
    Dim myRange As Range
    Dim i As Integer, j As Integer

    Set myRange = Worksheets("Sheet1").Range("A1:C5")

    For i = 1 To myRange.Rows.Count
        For j = 1 To myRange.Columns.Count
            myRange.Cells(i, j).Value = i * j
        Next j
    Next i

End Sub
```

This code updates the values of cells in the range A1:C5 on Sheet1 with the product of their row and column numbers.

## 3.3 Basic Operations

### Arithmetic Operators
VBA supports the following arithmetic operators:

-   `+` (Addition): Adds two numbers.
-   `-` (Subtraction): Subtracts one number from another.
-   `*` (Multiplication): Multiplies two numbers.
-   `/` (Division): Divides one number by another.
-   `\` (Integer Division): Divides one number by another and returns the integer part of the result.
-   `Mod` (Modulo): Returns the remainder of a division.
-   `^` (Exponentiation): Raises a number to a power.

**Example:**

```vba

Debug.Print x + y ' Output: 15
Debug.Print x - y ' Output: 5
Debug.Print x * y ' Output: 50
Debug.Print x / y ' Output: 2
Debug.Print x \ y ' Output: 2
Debug.Print x Mod y ' Output: 0
Debug.Print x ^ y ' Output: 100000
```

### Logical Operators
VBA supports the following logical operators:

-   `And`: Returns True if both operands are True.
-   `Or`: Returns True if either operand is True.
-   `Not`: Returns True if the operand is False.
-   `Xor`: Returns True if one operand is True and the other is False.

**Example:**

```vba

Debug.Print a Xor b ' Output: True
```

### Working with Cells/Ranges
VBA allows you to interact with cells and ranges in Excel worksheets.

-   **Range Object:** Represents a range of cells.

    ```vba
    Dim myRange As Range
    Set myRange = Range("A1:C5") ' Represents the range A1 to C5
    ```
-   **Cells Property:** Accesses a specific cell within a range.

    ```vba
    myRange.Cells(1, 1).Value = "Hello" ' Sets the value of cell A1 to "Hello"
    ```
-   **Value Property:** Gets or sets the value of a cell or range.

    ```vba
    Debug.Print Range("A1").Value ' Prints the value of cell A1
    Range("B2").Value = 100 ' Sets the value of cell B2 to 100
    ```

**Example:**
