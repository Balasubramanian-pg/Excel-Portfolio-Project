## 4.1 Conditional Statements

Conditional statements allow you to control the flow of execution in your VBA code based on certain conditions. VBA provides two main types of conditional statements: `If...Then...Else` and `Select Case`.

### If...Then...Else Statement

The `If...Then...Else` statement is used to execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false.

**Syntax:**

```vba
If condition Then
    ' Code to execute if the condition is True
[ElseIf condition2 Then
    ' Code to execute if condition2 is True
...]
[Else
    ' Code to execute if none of the conditions are True
End If
```

**Components:**

-   `If`: Keyword that starts the conditional statement.
-   `condition`: A Boolean expression that evaluates to either `True` or `False`.
-   `Then`: Keyword that indicates the start of the code block to execute if the condition is `True`.
-   `ElseIf`: Optional keyword that allows you to specify additional conditions to check if the previous condition is `False`. You can have multiple `ElseIf` blocks.
-   `Else`: Optional keyword that specifies a block of code to execute if none of the conditions are `True`.
-   `End If`: Keyword that marks the end of the `If` statement.

**Examples:**

1.  **Simple If...Then Statement:**

    ```vba
    Dim score As Integer
    score = 85

    If score >= 60 Then
        Debug.Print "Passed"
    End If
    ```

    This code checks if the `score` is greater than or equal to 60. If it is, it prints "Passed" to the Immediate Window.

2.  **If...Then...Else Statement:**

    ```vba
    Dim score As Integer
    score = 45

    If score >= 60 Then
        Debug.Print "Passed"
    Else
        Debug.Print "Failed"
    End If
    ```

    This code checks if the `score` is greater than or equal to 60. If it is, it prints "Passed"; otherwise, it prints "Failed".

3.  **If...Then...ElseIf...Else Statement:**

    ```vba
    Dim score As Integer
    score = 75

    If score >= 90 Then
        Debug.Print "Excellent"
    ElseIf score >= 80 Then
        Debug.Print "Very Good"
    ElseIf score >= 70 Then
        Debug.Print "Good"
    Else
        Debug.Print "Needs Improvement"
    End If
    ```

    This code checks the `score` against multiple conditions and prints a different message based on the score range.

### Select Case Statement

The `Select Case` statement is used to execute different blocks of code based on the value of a variable or expression. It provides a more structured and readable way to handle multiple conditions compared to nested `If` statements.

**Syntax:**

```vba
Select Case expression
    Case value1
        ' Code to execute if expression = value1
    [Case value2
        ' Code to execute if expression = value2
    ...]
    [Case Else
        ' Code to execute if expression does not match any of the values]
End Select
```

**Components:**

-   `Select Case`: Keyword that starts the `Select Case` statement.
-   `expression`: The variable or expression to evaluate.
-   `Case`: Keyword that specifies a value or range of values to compare against the expression.
-   `value1`, `value2`, etc.: The values to compare against the expression. These can be single values, ranges (using the `To` keyword), or lists of values (separated by commas).
-   `Case Else`: Optional keyword that specifies a block of code to execute if the expression does not match any of the `Case` values.
-   `End Select`: Keyword that marks the end of the `Select Case` statement.

**Examples:**

1.  **Simple Select Case Statement:**

    ```vba
    Dim grade As String
    grade = "B"

    Select Case grade
        Case "A"
            Debug.Print "Excellent"
        Case "B"
            Debug.Print "Good"
        Case "C"
            Debug.Print "Fair"
        Case Else
            Debug.Print "Needs Improvement"
    End Select
    ```

    This code checks the value of the `grade` variable and prints a different message based on the grade.

2.  **Select Case with Multiple Values:**

    ```vba
    Dim dayOfWeek As Integer
    dayOfWeek = 1 ' 1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, etc.

    Select Case dayOfWeek
        Case 1, 7
            Debug.Print "Weekend"
        Case 2 To 6
            Debug.Print "Weekday"
        Case Else
            Debug.Print "Invalid Day"
    End Select
    ```

    This code checks the value of the `dayOfWeek` variable and prints "Weekend" if it's 1 or 7, "Weekday" if it's between 2 and 6, and "Invalid Day" otherwise.

3.  **Select Case with Different Data Types:**

    ```vba
    Dim value As Variant
    value = 10

    Select Case value
        Case Is > 0
            Debug.Print "Positive"
        Case Is < 0
            Debug.Print "Negative"
        Case 0
            Debug.Print "Zero"
        Case Else
            Debug.Print "Not a Number"
    End Select
    ```

    This code checks the value of the `value` variable and prints a different message based on whether it's positive, negative, zero, or not a number.
