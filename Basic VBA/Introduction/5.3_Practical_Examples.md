## 5.3 Practical Examples

This section provides practical examples of how to use the Excel Object Model to perform common tasks in VBA.

### 1. Looping Through Worksheets

This example demonstrates how to loop through all worksheets in a workbook and print their names to the Immediate Window.

```vba
Sub LoopThroughWorksheets()
    Dim ws As Worksheet
    
    ' Loop through each worksheet in the active workbook
    For Each ws In ThisWorkbook.Worksheets
        Debug.Print ws.Name ' Print the worksheet name to the Immediate Window
    Next ws
    
End Sub
```

**Explanation:**

-   The code declares a variable `ws` of type `Worksheet`.
-   It then uses a `For Each...Next` loop to iterate through each `Worksheet` object in the `ThisWorkbook.Worksheets` collection.
-   Inside the loop, it prints the `Name` property of each worksheet to the Immediate Window using `Debug.Print`.

**Enhancements:**

-   You can modify this code to perform other actions on each worksheet, such as:
    -   Checking if the worksheet is visible.
    -   Calculating the used range.
    -   Copying data from the worksheet.

### 2. Formatting Ranges Dynamically

This example demonstrates how to format a range of cells dynamically based on their values.

```vba
Sub FormatRangesDynamically()
    Dim rng As Range
    Dim cell As Range
    
    ' Set the range to A1:C10 on Sheet1
    Set rng = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets("Sheet1").Range("A1:C10")
    
    ' Loop through each cell in the range
    For Each cell In rng
        ' Check if the cell value is greater than 50
        If cell.Value > 50 Then
            ' If it is, make the font bold and set the background color to yellow
            cell.Font.Bold = True
            cell.Interior.Color = RGB(255, 255, 0) ' Yellow
        Else
            ' Otherwise, make the font not bold and set the background color to white
            cell.Font.Bold = False
            cell.Interior.Color = RGB(255, 255, 255) ' White
        End If
    Next cell
    
End Sub
```

**Explanation:**

-   The code declares variables `rng` and `cell` of type `Range`.
-   It sets the `rng` variable to the range A1:C10 on Sheet1.
-   It then uses a `For Each...Next` loop to iterate through each cell in the range.
-   Inside the loop, it checks if the cell's `Value` is greater than 50.
-   If it is, it sets the `Font.Bold` property to `True` and the `Interior.Color` property to yellow.
-   Otherwise, it sets the `Font.Bold` property to `False` and the `Interior.Color` property to white.

**Enhancements:**

-   You can modify this code to use different formatting criteria, such as:
    -   Checking if the cell value is within a certain range.
    -   Checking if the cell contains a specific text string.
    -   Using different formatting options, such as font size, font color, or border style.

### 3. Copying Data Between Sheets

This example demonstrates how to copy data from one sheet to another.

```vba
Sub CopyDataBetweenSheets()
    Dim sourceSheet As Worksheet
    Dim destinationSheet As Worksheet
    Dim lastRow As Long
    
    ' Set source and destination sheets
    Set sourceSheet = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets("Sheet1")
    Set destinationSheet = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets("Sheet2")
    
    ' Find the last row with data in the source sheet
    lastRow = sourceSheet.Cells(sourceSheet.Rows.Count, "A").End(xlUp).Row
    
    ' Copy data from source to destination
    sourceSheet.Range("A1:C" & lastRow).Copy Destination:=destinationSheet.Range("A1")
    
    ' Optional: Clear the contents of the destination sheet before copying
    ' destinationSheet.Range("A1:C" & lastRow).ClearContents
    ' sourceSheet.Range("A1:C" & lastRow).Copy Destination:=destinationSheet.Range("A1")
End Sub
```

**Explanation:**

-   The code declares variables `sourceSheet` and `destinationSheet` of type `Worksheet`.
-   It sets the `sourceSheet` variable to Sheet1 and the `destinationSheet` variable to Sheet2.
-   It finds the last row with data in column A of the source sheet using the `End(xlUp).Row` property.
-   It then copies the data from the range A1:C[lastRow] on the source sheet to the range A1 on the destination sheet using the `Copy` method.

**Enhancements:**

-   You can modify this code to copy data from different ranges, worksheets, or workbooks.
-   You can also use different copy options, such as copying only the values, formats, or formulas.
-   You can add error handling to handle cases where the source sheet or destination sheet does not exist.

### 4. Creating a Dynamic Table

This example demonstrates how to create a dynamic table in Excel using VBA. A dynamic table automatically adjusts its size as data is added or removed.

```vba
Sub CreateDynamicTable()
    Dim ws As Worksheet
    Dim lastRow As Long
    Dim lastColumn As Long
    Dim tbl As ListObject

    ' Set the worksheet
    Set ws = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets("Sheet1")

    ' Find the last row and column with data
    lastRow = ws.Cells(ws.Rows.Count, "A").End(xlUp).Row
    lastColumn = ws.Cells(1, ws.Columns.Count).End(xlToLeft).Column

    ' Define the range for the table
    Dim tableRange As Range
    Set tableRange = ws.Range("A1", ws.Cells(lastRow, lastColumn))

    ' Check if a table already exists in the range
    For Each tbl In ws.ListObjects
        If Not Intersect(tableRange, tbl.Range) Is Nothing Then
            MsgBox "A table already exists in this range."
            Exit Sub
        End If
    Next tbl

    ' Create the table
    Set tbl = ws.ListObjects.Add(xlSrcRange, tableRange, , xlYes)

    ' Name the table
    tbl.Name = "DataTable"

    ' Optional: Format the table
    tbl.TableStyle = "TableStyleMedium1"

End Sub
```

**Explanation:**

-   The code first finds the last row and column with data in the worksheet.
-   It then defines a range that includes all the data.
-   It checks if a table already exists in the range.
-   If a table does not exist, it creates a new table using the `ListObjects.Add` method.
-   Finally, it names the table and applies a table style.

### 5. Adding a Chart to a Worksheet

This example demonstrates how to add a chart to a worksheet using VBA.

```vba
Sub AddChartToWorksheet()
    Dim ws As Worksheet
    Dim chartObj As ChartObject
    Dim chartRange As Range

    ' Set the worksheet
    Set ws = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets("Sheet1")

    ' Define the range for the chart
    Set chartRange = ws.Range("A1:B5")

    ' Create the chart object
    Set chartObj = ws.ChartObjects.Add(Left:=100, Top:=50, Width:=375, Height:=225)

    With chartObj.Chart
        ' Set the chart type
        .ChartType = xlColumnClustered

        ' Set the data source
        .SetSourceData Source:=chartRange

        ' Set chart title
        .HasTitle = True
        .ChartTitle.Text = "Sales Data"

        ' Set axis titles
        .Axes(xlCategory, xlPrimary).HasTitle = True
        .Axes(xlCategory, xlPrimary).AxisTitle.Text = "Product"

        .Axes(xlValue, xlPrimary).HasTitle = True
        .Axes(xlValue, xlPrimary).AxisTitle.Text = "Sales"
    End With

End Sub
```

**Explanation:**

-   The code first defines the range that will be used as the data source for the chart.
-   It then creates a new chart object using the `ChartObjects.Add` method.
-   Finally, it sets the chart type, data source, title, and axis titles using the properties of the `Chart` object.

These examples provide a starting point for using the Excel Object Model to automate tasks and create custom solutions in VBA. By exploring the properties and methods of the various objects, you can unlock the full potential of Excel and VBA.
