## 4.2 Loops

Loops are fundamental control structures in VBA that allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly. VBA provides several types of loops, each suited for different scenarios.

### For...Next Loop

The `For...Next` loop is used to execute a block of code a specific number of times. It's ideal when you know in advance how many iterations are needed.

**Syntax:**

```vba
For counter = start To end [Step step]
    ' Code to execute
Next [counter]
```

**Components:**

-   `For`: Keyword that starts the `For` loop.
-   `counter`: A numeric variable that acts as a counter. It's incremented (or decremented) with each iteration of the loop.
-   `start`: The initial value of the counter.
-   `end`: The final value of the counter. The loop continues until the counter exceeds this value.
-   `Step`: Optional keyword that specifies the increment or decrement value for the counter. If omitted, the default value is 1.
-   `Next`: Keyword that marks the end of the `For` loop and increments (or decrements) the counter.
-   `[counter]`: Optional. You can specify the counter variable after the `Next` keyword for clarity, especially in nested loops.

**Examples:**

1.  **Looping with a Step of 1:**

    ```vba
    Dim i As Integer
    For i = 1 To 5
        Debug.Print "Iteration: " & i
    Next i
    ```

    This code will print "Iteration: 1" through "Iteration: 5" to the Immediate Window.

2.  **Looping with a Step Greater Than 1:**

    ```vba
    Dim i As Integer
    For i = 0 To 10 Step 2
        Debug.Print "Number: " & i
    Next i
    ```

    This code will print "Number: 0", "Number: 2", "Number: 4", "Number: 6", "Number: 8", and "Number: 10" to the Immediate Window.

3.  **Looping with a Negative Step (Decrementing):**

    ```vba
    Dim i As Integer
    For i = 10 To 1 Step -1
        Debug.Print "Countdown: " & i
    Next i
    ```

    This code will print "Countdown: 10" down to "Countdown: 1" to the Immediate Window.

### For Each...Next Loop

The `For Each...Next` loop is used to iterate over all the elements in a collection or array. It's particularly useful when you don't know the number of elements in advance.

**Syntax:**

```vba
For Each element In group
    ' Code to execute
Next [element]
```

**Components:**

-   `For Each`: Keyword that starts the `For Each` loop.
-   `element`: A variable that represents the current element in the collection or array. The data type of this variable should be compatible with the elements in the collection or array.
-   `In`: Keyword that separates the element variable from the collection or array.
-   `group`: The collection or array to iterate over. This can be a `Worksheets` collection, a `Range` object, an array, or any other object that supports iteration.
-   `Next`: Keyword that marks the end of the `For Each` loop and moves to the next element in the collection or array.
-   `[element]`: Optional. You can specify the element variable after the `Next` keyword for clarity, especially in nested loops.

**Examples:**

1.  **Iterating Through Worksheets:**

    ```vba
    Dim ws As Worksheet
    For Each ws In ThisWorkbook.Worksheets
        Debug.Print ws.Name
    Next ws
    ```

    This code will print the name of each worksheet in the current workbook to the Immediate Window.

2.  **Iterating Through Cells in a Range:**

    ```vba
    Dim cell As Range
    For Each cell In Worksheets("Sheet1").Range("A1:C5")
        Debug.Print cell.Address & ": " & cell.Value
    Next cell
    ```

    This code will print the address and value of each cell in the range A1:C5 on Sheet1 to the Immediate Window.

3.  **Iterating Through an Array:**

    ```vba
    Dim myArray(1 To 3) As String
    myArray(1) = "Apple"
    myArray(2) = "Banana"
    myArray(3) = "Cherry"

    Dim item As Variant ' Use Variant for arrays with different data types
    For Each item In myArray
        Debug.Print item
    Next item
    ```

    This code will print each element in the `myArray` to the Immediate Window.

### Do While...Loop

The `Do While...Loop` executes a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition remains true. The condition is checked *before* each iteration of the loop.

**Syntax:**

```vba
Do While condition
    ' Code to execute
Loop
```

**Components:**

-   `Do While`: Keywords that start the `Do While` loop.
-   `condition`: A Boolean expression that is evaluated before each iteration. If the condition is `True`, the code inside the loop is executed. If the condition is `False`, the loop terminates.
-   `Loop`: Keyword that marks the end of the `Do While` loop.

**Example:**

```vba
Dim i As Integer
i = 1

Do While i <= 5
    Debug.Print "Number: " & i
    i = i + 1
Loop
```

This code will print "Number: 1" through "Number: 5" to the Immediate Window. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to 5.

### Do Until...Loop

The `Do Until...Loop` executes a block of code repeatedly until a specified condition becomes true. The condition is checked *before* each iteration of the loop.

**Syntax:**

```vba
Do Until condition
    ' Code to execute
Loop
```

**Components:**

-   `Do Until`: Keywords that start the `Do Until` loop.
-   `condition`: A Boolean expression that is evaluated before each iteration. If the condition is `False`, the code inside the loop is executed. If the condition is `True`, the loop terminates.
-   `Loop`: Keyword that marks the end of the `Do Until` loop.

**Example:**

```vba
Dim i As Integer
i = 1

Do Until i > 5
    Debug.Print "Number: " & i
    i = i + 1
Loop
```

This code will print "Number: 1" through "Number: 5" to the Immediate Window. The loop continues until `i` is greater than 5.

### Do...Loop While

The `Do...Loop While` loop is similar to the `Do While...Loop`, but the condition is checked *after* each iteration of the loop. This means that the code inside the loop will always be executed at least once, even if the condition is initially false.

**Syntax:**

```vba
Do
    ' Code to execute
Loop While condition
```

**Example:**

```vba
Dim i As Integer
i = 1

Do
    Debug.Print "Number: " & i
    i = i + 1
Loop While i <= 5
```

### Do...Loop Until

The `Do...Loop Until` loop is similar to the `Do Until...Loop`, but the condition is checked *after* each iteration of the loop. This means that the code inside the loop will always be executed at least once, even if the condition is initially true.

**Syntax:**

```vba
Do
    ' Code to execute
Loop Until condition
```

**Example:**

```vba
Dim i As Integer
i = 1

Do
    Debug.Print "Number: " & i
    i = i + 1
Loop Until i > 5
```

### Exiting Loops

You can exit a loop prematurely using the `Exit For` (for `For` loops) or `Exit Do` (for `Do` loops) statements. This is useful when you need to terminate the loop based on a certain condition.

**Example:**

```vba
Dim i As Integer
For i = 1 To 10
    If i > 5 Then
        Exit For ' Exit the loop when i is greater than 5
    End If
    Debug.Print "Number: " & i
Next i
```

This code will print "Number: 1" through "Number: 5" to the Immediate Window and then exit the loop.
