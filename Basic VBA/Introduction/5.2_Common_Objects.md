Debug.Print ws.Index ' Output: The index number of the worksheet

ws.Activate ' Activate the worksheet
```

### 4. Range Object

The `Range` object is one of the most commonly used objects in VBA. It represents a single cell or a range of cells in a worksheet and provides access to the contents, formatting, and other properties of those cells.

**More Details:**

-   A `Range` object can represent a single cell, a row, a column, a block of cells, or even a non-contiguous selection of cells.
-   You can use the `Range` property of the `Worksheet` object to get a `Range` object.
-   You can also use the `Cells` property of the `Worksheet` object to access individual cells within a worksheet.

**Key Properties:**

-   `Value`: Gets or sets the value of the range. This is the most commonly used property of the `Range` object.
-   `Address`: Returns the address of the range (e.g., "$A$1", "$A$1:$C$5").
-   `Rows`: Returns a `Range` object that represents the rows in the range.
-   `Columns`: Returns a `Range` object that represents the columns in the range.
-   `Count`: Returns the number of cells in the range.
-   `Interior`: Returns an `Interior` object that represents the interior of the range (for formatting).
-   `Font`: Returns a `Font` object that represents the font of the range (for formatting).
-   `Borders`: Returns a `Borders` object that represents the borders of the range (for formatting).
-    `NumberFormat`: Gets or sets the format code for the range.

**Key Methods:**

-   `Clear`: Clears the contents and formatting of the range.
-   `ClearContents`: Clears only the contents of the range.
-   `ClearFormats`: Clears only the formatting of the range.
-   `Copy`: Copies the range to the clipboard or another location.
-   `Cut`: Cuts the range to the clipboard.
-   `Delete`: Deletes the range (shifts surrounding cells).
-   `Insert`: Inserts cells into the range (shifts existing cells).
-   `Select`: Selects the range.
-   `AutoFit`: Auto-fits the columns or rows in the range to their contents.

**Examples:**

```vba
Dim myRange As Range
Set myRange = Worksheets("Sheet1").Range("A1:C5")

myRange.Value = "Hello" ' Sets the value of all cells in the range to "Hello"
Debug.Print myRange.Address ' Output: $A$1:$C$5

myRange.Font.Bold = True ' Make the font bold
myRange.Interior.Color = RGB(255, 255, 0) ' Set the background color to yellow
```

#### 5. Cells Object

The `Cells` property of the `Worksheet` object returns a `Range` object that represents all the cells on the worksheet. You can also use the `Cells` property to access individual cells using their row and column indices.

**More Details:**

-   The `Cells` property is a convenient way to access cells using numeric indices, which can be useful when working with loops or dynamic cell references.

**Properties:**

-   `Count`: Returns the number of cells in the collection (i.e., the total number of cells on the worksheet).

**Methods:**

-   You typically access individual cells using the `Item` property (or by directly using the row and column indices).

**Examples:**

```vba
Worksheets("Sheet1").Cells(1, 1).Value = "Hello" ' Sets the value of cell A1 to "Hello"
Debug.Print Worksheets("Sheet1").Cells.Count ' Output: The total number of cells on Sheet1

Dim i As Integer
For i = 1 To 10
    Worksheets("Sheet1").Cells(i, 1).Value = i ' Fill cells A1:A10 with numbers 1 to 10
Next i
```
