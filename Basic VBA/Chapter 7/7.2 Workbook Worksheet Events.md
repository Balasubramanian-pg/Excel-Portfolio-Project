## 7.2 Workbook/Worksheet Events

Events are actions that occur in Excel, such as opening a workbook, activating a worksheet, or changing a cell value. VBA allows you to write code that responds to these events, enabling you to create dynamic and interactive applications. Workbook and Worksheet events are particularly useful for automating tasks and customizing the behavior of Excel.

### Understanding Events

-   **Event Handlers:** VBA procedures that are executed when a specific event occurs.
-   **Event-Driven Programming:** A programming paradigm where the flow of execution is determined by events.
-   **Event Arguments:** Many event handlers receive arguments that provide information about the event, such as the target range or the type of change that occurred.

### Workbook Events

Workbook events are triggered by actions that occur at the workbook level, such as opening, closing, saving, or activating a workbook. To access workbook event handlers:

1.  **Open the VBA Editor:** Press Alt + F11 to open the VBA editor.
2.  **Open the ThisWorkbook Module:** In the Project Explorer, double-click on the `ThisWorkbook` object.
3.  **Select the Event:** In the Code window, select "Workbook" from the left dropdown and then select the desired event from the right dropdown.

#### Common Workbook Events:

-   **Workbook_Open:** Triggered when a workbook is opened.

    ```vba
    Private Sub Workbook_Open()
        ' Code to execute when the workbook is opened
        MsgBox "Welcome to this workbook!"
    End Sub
    ```

-   **Workbook_BeforeClose:** Triggered before a workbook is closed.

    ```vba
    Private Sub Workbook_BeforeClose(Cancel As Boolean)
        ' Code to execute before the workbook is closed
        Dim response As Integer
        response = MsgBox("Do you want to save changes?", vbYesNoCancel)
        If response = vbYes Then
            ThisWorkbook.Save
        ElseIf response = vbCancel Then
            Cancel = True ' Cancel the close operation
        End If
    End Sub
    ```

-   **Workbook_BeforeSave:** Triggered before a workbook is saved.

    ```vba
    Private Sub Workbook_BeforeSave(ByVal SaveAsUI As Boolean, Cancel As Boolean)
        ' Code to execute before the workbook is saved
        If SaveAsUI Then
            ' The user is trying to save the workbook with a new name or format
            ' You can add code here to validate the new filename or format
        End If
    End Sub
    ```

-   **Workbook_SheetActivate:** Triggered when a worksheet is activated.

    ```vba
    Private Sub Workbook_SheetActivate(ByVal Sh As Object)
        ' Code to execute when a worksheet is activated
        Debug.Print "Worksheet " & Sh.Name & " activated"
    End Sub
    ```

### Worksheet Events

Worksheet events are triggered by actions that occur at the worksheet level, such as activating a worksheet, changing a cell value, or selecting a range of cells. To access worksheet event handlers:

1.  **Open the VBA Editor:** Press Alt + F11 to open the VBA editor.
2.  **Open the Worksheet Module:** In the Project Explorer, double-click on the worksheet object for which you want to create event handlers.
3.  **Select the Event:** In the Code window, select "Worksheet" from the left dropdown and then select the desired event from the right dropdown.

#### Common Worksheet Events:

-   **Worksheet_Activate:** Triggered when a worksheet is activated.

    ```vba
    Private Sub Worksheet_Activate()
        ' Code to execute when the worksheet is activated
        MsgBox "Welcome to " & Me.Name & "!"
    End Sub
    ```

-   **Worksheet_Change:** Triggered when a cell in the worksheet is changed.

    ```vba
    Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range)
        ' Code to execute when a cell is changed
        If Target.Column = 1 Then
            ' Convert the text in column A to uppercase
            Target.Value = UCase(Target.Value)
        End If
    End Sub
    ```

-   **Worksheet_SelectionChange:** Triggered when the selection changes on the worksheet.

    ```vba
    Private Sub Worksheet_SelectionChange(ByVal Target As Range)
        ' Code to execute when the selection changes
        Debug.Print "Selected range: " & Target.Address
    End Sub
    ```

-   **Worksheet_BeforeDoubleClick:** Triggered before a cell is double-clicked.

    ```vba
    Private Sub Worksheet_BeforeDoubleClick(ByVal Target As Range, Cancel As Boolean)
        ' Code to execute before a cell is double-clicked
        If Target.Value = "Secret" Then
            MsgBox "You found the secret!"
            Cancel = True ' Prevent the default double-click action
        End If
    End Sub
    ```

### Example: Data Validation with Worksheet_Change

Let's create an example that uses the `Worksheet_Change` event to validate data entered into a specific column:

```vba
Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range)
    Dim keyRange As Range, cell As Range
    Set keyRange = Range("C1:C10")

    ' Only do something if the Target is one of the watched cells
    If Not Application.Intersect(Target, keyRange) Is Nothing Then
        Application.EnableEvents = False ' Prevent endless loop
        For Each cell In Target
            If Not IsNumeric(cell.Value) Then
                MsgBox "Only numbers are allowed in this column."
                cell.Value = "" ' Clear the invalid entry
            End If
        Next cell
        Application.EnableEvents = True
    End If
End Sub
```

**Explanation:**

-   The code defines a range `keyRange` that represents the cells in column C where data validation should be applied.
-   It then uses the `Application.Intersect` method to check if the changed cell is within the `keyRange`.
-   If the changed cell is within the `keyRange`, the code checks if the cell value is numeric using the `IsNumeric` function.
-   If the cell value is not numeric, the code displays a message box and clears the cell value.
-   `Application.EnableEvents = False` and `Application.EnableEvents = True` are used to prevent the `Worksheet_Change` event from being triggered recursively when the code clears the cell value.

By using Workbook and Worksheet events, you can create powerful and automated solutions that respond to user actions and customize the behavior of Excel. Remember to explore the available events and their arguments to fully leverage the power of VBA.
